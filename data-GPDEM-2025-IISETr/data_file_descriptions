Route Data Structure

Column	                        Description
DEMAND_ID	                    Identifier for the demand or commodity. Each unique value represents a specific product flow requirement.
ROUTE_NBR	                    Unique route identifier. Each route describes a distinct combination of legs serving the same demand.
ORIGIN_ID	                    Origin location ID (typically a vendor).
DEST1, DEST2, DEST3, FINAL_DEST	Intermediate and final destination nodes that define the sequence of the route.
LEG1, LEG2, LEG3	            Leg identifiers used to connect to lane data. Each leg represents a transportation arc between two consecutive nodes.
LEG1_TYPE, LEG2_TYPE, LEG3_TYPE	Type of movement for each leg (e.g., Vendor to LMD, Vendor to FC, FC to LMD).
LEG1_DIST, LEG2_DIST, LEG3_DIST	Distance (in miles) traveled for each leg. Zero values indicate the absence of that leg for shorter routes.
HANDLING_PER_LB	                Handling cost per pound, representing the operational cost associated with managing volume at intermediate nodes.
WGT	                            Total shipment weight in pounds for this route.
DIST	                        Total route distance, equal to the sum of leg distances.
LEGS	                        Number of arcs (legs) that make up the route. Single-leg routes are direct; multi-leg routes include intermediate stops.
DR_DIST	                        Direct (origin-to-destination) distance if the shipment were sent without intermediate nodes.
SALES	                        Total sales value of the commodity being shipped on the route.
COGS	                        Cost of goods sold associated with the commodity.
FIXED	                        Fixed portion of the route’s travel time, expressed in days.
LT_UPPER_BD	                    Lead time upper bound (days). Represents the maximum guaranteed delivery time for this demand.
TRANS_MODE	                    Mode of the final inbound leg to the last-mile delivery. Examples include TL (Truckload) and LTL (Less-Than-Truckload).
W_HAT	                        Allowed waiting time for this route, computed as the difference between LT_UPPER_BD and the fixed transit time.
DR_MODE	                        Mode of the equivalent direct route (0 if not direct).
DR_COST	                        Cost of the direct route. Zero indicates that the route is not a direct movement.
DR_FREQ	                        Frequency or number of dispatches for the direct route. Zero indicates no direct option available.


Lane Data Structure

Column	        Description
LEG_ID	        Unique identifier for each leg (arc). Each leg connects a specific origin and destination pair.
MODE	        Shipment mode indicator: 0 = Truckload (TL), 1–3 = Less-Than-Truckload (LTL) categories. Leg + mode = lane.
ORIGIN_ID	    Origin node ID. 
ORIGIN_TYPE	    Type of the origin node, either "VND" (vendor) or "FC" (fulfillment center).
DEST_ID	        Destination node ID.
DEST_TYPE	    Type of destination node, either "FC“ or "LMD” (last-mile delivery center).
DISTANCE	    Distance between the origin and destination, in miles.
MIN_WEIGHT	    Minimum shipment weight allowed for that mode, in pounds.
MAX_WEIGHT	    Maximum shipment weight capacity for that mode, in pounds.
COST_PER_POUND	Variable cost per pound for shipment. Applicable only to certain LTL modes (modes 1 and 3 in this data).
FIXED_COST	    Fixed cost of dispatching one shipment on this lane, regardless of weight.
TRANSIT_TIME	Estimated travel time (in days) for this lane and mode. LTL modes typically have longer transit times than truckload.


Conversion Rate Data Structure:

Column      Description
LT          Lead time in days.
PREDICTION  Percentage of customers expected to make a purchase given the lead time.
